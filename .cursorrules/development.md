# Software Development

1. Before the implementation (any code writing) let me know where we stand, what the ideas for the solution (or echo back from the prompt to ensure we are clear on what to build), then we will give a final acceptance before any code is written.
2. Please do not make any commits until we have tested the feature locally.
3. We use docker for development so see @docker-compose.yml
